# DawnChorus

A utility for managing all my social media accounts etc. Yes, it's old and a bit ramshackle, and some of the things it originally did are obsolete (like the mailing lists - I mean, the C.C.Cafe itself has closed down) but it gets by, and it will hopefully improve as new requirements come along. Much easier to refactor now I have a proper dev machine and github :)
